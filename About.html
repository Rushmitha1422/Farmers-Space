            <h2>Who we Are?</h2>      
            <p>Farmers space is the space where we create the interface between the farmers and the customer. For the enhancement of the farmers economy with giving assurance to the customer by providing nutritious and fresh food.
                In this platform we abide by bringing up the best and farm fresh food for our customers, without letting down our farmers loose their economic stability due to the middlemen in selling their valuable products for 
                low market prices.
                We tend to bring on the customer and farmer familiarity through out our website. There could be many platforms regarding fresh food,  but with our website we want to create a true platform.
                We show case the farmers hard work in cultivating the nutritious food by allowing all the payments for the sold products to our very own farmers.
                Through this interface we assure to create the best access to the organic version of every product we bring up to you.
            </p>
                  
            <h2>How we work?</h2>
            <p>We work on  making a direct interaction between the farmers and the customers. So, we first educate our farmers on how we work by letting them know that, we update all the information of the food items 
                they cultivate and then we get to know about the actual cost of the products by considering market prices and the farmers individual expenditure.
                As we encourage organic and sustainable farming methods like using natural fertilizers, plant and animal waste based composts, crop rotation to increase the fertility of the soil. We try to make sure 
                the customers know about these methods so that the they know about the actual hard work the farmers do to make our plates nutritious.
                We update all of these details in our website and then the products prizes accurately to make them affordable yet natural and economic friendly to both customers and farmers. We make sure we forward 
                all the payment transactions to the farmers who produced the products.  
            </p>
                            
            <h2>Our Motive!</h2>
            <p>As the children of the farmer's generation, we tend to see the difficulties of our Indian farmers more clearly. Though India is mostly dependent on agriculture, we tend to neglect farmers in many ways.
                To make our farmers more reliable in this modern and economically developing country, we want to make sure our farmers come into the limelight of utilizing technology. We created this interface as a
                bridge to make the farmers feel accessible to technology and the customers feel reachable to their desirable fresh food.
            </p>
                     
            <h2>We focus on.</h2>
            <p>As we mentioned about the farmer and customer benefits, we want to make sure that the customers from urban and metropolitan cities who strive for fresh and nutritious food, as they recognize the need 
                for organic farming benefits to their lifestyle, always end up finding more unreliable options. We make sure that we satisfy their requirements with the farmers who cultivate organic products for 
                customer benefits, and customers recognize the farmers dedication and hard work in bringing the best products to them.
